          <h2>E-Commerce Website</h2>
          <h4>Major Project</h4>
          <p>
            For this assignment, I designed a website for BaeShore, a swimwear
            brand, focusing on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly
            interface. The project includes an "About Us" section that
            highlights the brand's history and commitment to quality and
            sustainability, accompanied by clean design elements such as brand
            imagery and custom typography. The goal was to capture the essence
            of the beach lifestyle while implementing responsive design,
            effective layout techniques, and attention to visual consistency
            across different sections.
          </p>

            feedback for design consistency and user experience execution.
